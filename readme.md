## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About The Project

This was an Agile project leveraging JIRA and mimicking a sprint. We were given a list of required features/functionality and a figma mockup.

### The Application:
InStock is a fully-fledged warehouse and inventory tracking full-stack web application. It is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring full responsiveness across different screen sizes.


### The Approach:
- **Requirement Breakdown:** We divided the project requirements into manageable tickets, accurately estimating the effort required in developer hours for each task.

- **Sprint Planning:** Our team meticulously planned each sprint, strategically assigning tickets to team members based on their expertise and availability.

- **Rotating Leadership:** To foster collaboration and ensure accountability, each team member took turns serving as the team lead for a day. During their leadership day, they were responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests from other team members.

- **Daily Stand-ups:** Every morning, we convened for a brief stand-up meeting to discuss our progress, address any challenges or blockers encountered during ticket execution, and coordinate efforts to ensure seamless workflow.


### Features:
- **View all Warehouses:** Users can see a list of all warehouses along with their details.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Warehouses:** Users have the ability to add new warehouses, edit existing ones, and delete warehouses as needed.
- **View Warehouse Details:** Users can view detailed information about a specific warehouse, including its inventory.
- **Edit/Delete Inventory:** Users can make changes to the inventory of a specific warehouse, including editing and deleting items.
- **View All Inventory:** Users can see a comprehensive list of all inventory items, along with the warehouse to which each item belongs.
- **Sort and Search:** Users can sort the warehouse and inventory lists based on different criteria and perform searches to filter the results.
